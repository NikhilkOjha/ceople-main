# Chat Functionality Test Guide

## ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Background Video 404 Error**: Removed missing bg.mp4 reference from Auth.tsx
2. **Duplicate User Queue Error**: Added cleanup logic to remove existing queue entries before adding new ones
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed type annotations and useCallback dependencies
4. **Build Success**: Application builds without errors

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Authentication Test
- [ ] Visit http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Should redirect to /auth if not authenticated
- [ ] Sign up with email/password
- [ ] Should redirect to home page after successful auth

### 2. Home Page Test
- [ ] Should display welcome message
- [ ] Should show three chat options:
  - Start Video Chat
  - Start Text Chat  
  - Start Both
- [ ] Should show user info and sign out button

### 3. Chat Queue Test
- [ ] Click "Start Video Chat"
- [ ] Should show "Looking for a stranger..." message
- [ ] Should add user to queue without duplicate errors
- [ ] Should be able to cancel and return to home

### 4. Video Chat Test (Requires 2 browsers/users)
- [ ] Open two browser windows/tabs
- [ ] Sign in with different accounts
- [ ] Both click "Start Video Chat"
- [ ] Should connect and show video streams
- [ ] Test video/audio toggle buttons
- [ ] Test text chat functionality
- [ ] Test "Next" button to find new stranger

### 5. Text Chat Test
- [ ] Click "Start Text Chat"
- [ ] Should connect for text-only chat
- [ ] Test sending and receiving messages
